# Database_Project

This Project is aimed on developing a php mysql based database system.
CSS was used for style and in the back end I used mysql to develop the database.
We will be developing this project time to time.
for any kind of help feel free to contact me in my mail rajuahmad6789@gmail.com.

php version 7.2.7 was used in this project and mysql was used for the database. You also need to have some basic knowledge about ajax, jquery and javascript to understand this project well. 

At first you need to import the .sql file to your database using xampp or similiar type of software and you are ready to go...
